To build the application and run the test cases, please execute

    cd CoffeeMachine
    mvn clean verify

You can import the `CoffeeMachine` project as Maven project into your IDE. You can then either execute the `testEspresso` test case in the `org.thoughts.on.java.coffee.TestCoffeeMachine` or use the `org.thoughts.on.java.coffee.CoffeeApp` class to run it as a Java application.
